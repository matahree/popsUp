If a user clicks on that 'USE CASE' labeled news, they will be directed to the article. Each of these articles contains a pop-up message which I have created. I have attached a PDF containing the EULAs; clicking on it grants the user the ability to go through the file without having to download it.

Furthermore, the pop-up box gives the user the option to agree or disagree with EULAs. When the user agrees, the pop-up message closes which allows them to continue navigating. On the other side when the user disagrees, it redirects them to the main page not allowing them to continue.


I opted for this simplistic method which is just having a box overlaying the article making it almost impossible for the user to not see the message & at the same time seamless and easy to navigate through. 

I used very little CSS and JS to make this which makes it easy to expand the code and develop it further if needed. When the user accepts or disagrees, the information gets stored locally so they do not have to keep seeing the box, but for demonstration purposes, I opted to remove that from the code.

Also, I used a white background and basic colors for the CSS. Because your website has pretty light colors already. That would fit best.
