If a user clicks on that 'USE CASE' labeled news, they will be directed to the article. Each of these articles contains a pop-up message which I have created. I have attached a PDF containing the EULAs; clicking on it grants the user the ability to go through the file without having to download it.

Furthermore, the pop-up box gives the user the option to agree or disagree with EULAs. When the user agrees, the pop-up message closes which allows them to continue navigating. On the other side when the user disagrees, it redirects them to the main page not allowing them to continue.
